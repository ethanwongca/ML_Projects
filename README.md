# ML Projects
<h2> Objective </h2>
Mini Machine Learning projects I did to learn ML. From linear regression, convolutional neural networks, q-learning, k-means etc.

<h2> Projects <h2/>

<h3> Linear Regression Projects </h3>

Used sklearn to create a linear regression model using boston housing. I also created a model that can predict prices.

I also did similar with titanic data. Other libraries that were used are pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy.

<h3> K-Means Model </h3>

I made a K-Means model to test with sklearn as well. And the libraries mentioned before/

<h3> Convolutional Neural Network Project </h3>

Using the fashion MNIST I made a convolutional neural network that can determine different types of articles of clothing. I used a 30/70 testing and training set. In this project I used the library Keras from tensorflow. I also used sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy as well.

<h3> Q-Learning </h3>

I also made a Q-Learning project here I used gym, numpy, and Bellman's equations to make the computer when at a taxi game. I also did a similar thing with space invaders.

<h3> Google Gym Atari Games </h3>

I used reinforcement learning with Atari games. This was acquired from using Google Gym.
