# ML Projects
<h2> Objective </h2>
The following projects I did to learn the basics of some machine learning, and to get started with knowledge in the field. The following projects covered these topics: linear regression, k-means, deep learning: convolutional neural networks, and q-learning. Enjoy!
<h2> Projects <h2/>

<h3> Linear Regression Projects </h3>
  
<strong>Libraries</strong>: SkLearn, Pandas, Seaborn MatPlotLib, and Numpy  

<strong>Projects</strong>: Two projects were done related to linear regression. One was predicting housing prices in boston, while the other was predicting the survival of people on the titanic. Here are some imaages ot the titanic project below. I used a 70%-30% test and validation sets. <br>

<h3> K-Means Model </h3>

<strong>Libraries</strong>: Seaborn, MatPlotLib, SkLearn
  
<strong>Projects</strong>: This project I had an array of data, and given the array I had created a k-means model to group this data in four seperate compartments.

<h3> Convolutional Neural Network Project </h3>

<strong>Libraries</strong>: Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn, Random, and TensorFlow 
  
<strong>Projects</strong>: Using the fashion MNIST I made a convolutional neural network that can determine different types of articles of clothing. I used a 30/70 testing and training set. In this project I used the library Keras from tensorflow.

<h3> Q-Learning </h3>
  
<strong>Libraries</strong>: Gym, Numpy
  
<strong>Projects</strong>: I also made a Q-Learning project here I used gym, numpy, and Bellman's equations to make the computer win a specific taxi game, and score the highest possible score.

<h3> Google Gym Atari Games (Reinforcement Learning)</h3>
  
<strong>Libraries</strong>: Keras Sequential Model (Layers: Dense, Dropout, Concetenate), Google Gym, Numpy
  
<strong>Projects</strong>: I used reinforcement learning with Atari games. This was acquired from using Google Gym.<img width="244" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 1 24 24 AM" src="https://github.com/ethanwongca/MiniMachineLearningProjects/assets/87055387/bc5562cf-f30d-4cd0-b1d3-ef647ef381ca">
